# Godot-Action-Combat
Trying to recreate The combat system from Tera online but with more indepth mechanics, this project is way beyond my capacities but its the first ever time I have had fun with programming stuff

it has:
-swimming
-free third person camera
-optional strafing
-melee combat with a crossair instead of lock on or tab target
