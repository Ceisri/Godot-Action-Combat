# Godot-Action-Combat
Trying to recreate The combat system from Tera online but with more indepth mechanics, this project is way beyond my capacities but its the first ever time I have had fun with programming stuff

it has: 

-3D terrain with shader for multiple textures based on height and angle 

-Swimming

-Climbing

-Dodging

-Parrying/Blocking/Guarding

-Walk/Run/Sprint

-Mobile controls

-Minimap

-Free third person camera

-Optional strafing

-Melee combat with a crossair instead of lock on or tab target

-Exercise mode for fitness games and dancing
